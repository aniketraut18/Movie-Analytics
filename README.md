# Movie-Analytics

In this project, I worked on a movie ratings dataset, aiming to uncover whether the average rating in a sample significantly differs from the overall population mean. By applying hypothesis testing, I explored whether any observed differences were statistically significant or just due to random chance. This analysis provides a solid example of how statistical methods can be used to draw meaningful conclusions from data.

Working:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - I started by gathering a dataset of movie ratings and spent some time cleaning and preparing the data. This involved handling missing values and ensuring that the data was in good shape for analysis.
  
2. Hypothesis Testing:
   - The main focus of the project was on hypothesis testing. I conducted two types of tests:
     - Two-tailed test: I wanted to see if the average rating in my sample was significantly different from the population average, in either direction.
     - One-tailed test: Here, I checked if the sample mean was specifically higher or lower than the population mean.
   - For both tests, I compared the p-values against my chosen significance level to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.

3. Interpreting Results:
   - I carefully interpreted the results from the hypothesis tests. If the p-value was higher than the significance level, I didnâ€™t have enough evidence to say there was a significant difference. However, if the p-value was lower, I concluded that the difference was significant.
  
4. Visualization:
   - To make the results more digestible, I created visualizations like histograms and box plots. These helped in showing the distribution of ratings and the outcomes of the tests in a clear and concise manner.

Learning:
Through this project, I got a hands-on experience with statistical hypothesis testing. It reinforced the importance of data preparation and taught me how to properly set up and interpret both one-tailed and two-tailed tests. I also sharpened my skills with Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, which were essential for the analysis and visualization work.

Conclusion:
This project was a great exercise in applying statistical theory to real-world data. By running these hypothesis tests, I was able to determine whether differences in movie ratings were statistically significant or just due to chance. The project has solidified my understanding of how to use data-driven methods to make informed decisions.
